# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Why AI?

As of March 2025, advanced Language Learning Models (LLMs) have achieved a Codeforces rating of approximately 2000, demonstrating their significant capabilities in problem-solving. LLMs serve as valuable learning companions by:

- Exploring alternative solution approaches
- Offering patient responses to fundamental questions
- Providing detailed explanations for complex problems
- Enhancing the overall learning experience through interactive problem-solving

Their ability to analyze and explain different approaches makes them excellent tools for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.
