### Solution Explanation

1. **Total Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first n natural numbers is calculated using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
2. **Check Even Sum**: If the total sum is odd, output 0 immediately as partitioning is impossible.
3. **DP Array Initialization**: The DP array `dp[i][j]` is initialized where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form sum `j` using the first `i` numbers.
4. **DP Transition**: For each number `i` and each possible sum `j`, update the DP array by either including or excluding the current number.
5. **Adjust Result**: Since each valid partition is counted twice, the result is divided by 2 using modular arithmetic (multiplying by the modular inverse of 2).

### Why do we need inverse modular


Let's break down why we need the modular inverse of 2 and how it works in this problem.

### **Key Idea: Overcounting Partitions**
When we use dynamic programming (DP) to count subsets that sum to `totalSum / 2`, we count **every valid partition twice**:
1. Once for subset **A** (e.g., `{1, 3, 4, 6}` in the example).
2. Once for subset **B** (e.g., `{2, 5, 7}` in the example).

These are two representations of the **same partition**, but the DP treats them as distinct. Thus, the final result from the DP table (`dp[n][target]`) is **double** the correct answer. To fix this, we divide by 2.

---

### **The Problem with Division in Modular Arithmetic**
In normal arithmetic, dividing by 2 is straightforward. But in modular arithmetic (where we work modulo `1e9+7`), division is not defined directly. Instead, we use the **modular inverse**.

#### What is a Modular Inverse?
For a prime modulus `mod` (like `1e9+7`), the modular inverse of a number `a` is a value `b` such that:
```
a × b ≡ 1 (mod mod)
```
This inverse exists **only if `a` and `mod` are coprime**. Since `1e9+7` is prime and `2` is not a multiple of it, the inverse exists.

---

### **Finding the Modular Inverse of 2**
For `mod = 1e9+7`, the inverse of 2 is **500,000,004**. We can verify this:
```
2 × 500,000,004 = 1,000,000,008
1,000,000,008 mod 1e9+7 = 1
```

#### Why 500,000,004?
By Fermat’s Little Theorem, the modular inverse of `a` modulo `mod` (a prime) is `a^(mod-2) mod mod`. For `a = 2`:
```
inverse = 2^(1e9+7 - 2) mod 1e9+7
```
This calculation gives `500,000,004`, but we don’t need to compute it manually—it’s a known constant.

---

### **How It Fixes the Overcounting**
The DP result `dp[n][target]` is twice the correct answer. To adjust:
```
correct_answer = (dp[n][target] × inverse_of_2) mod 1e9+7
```
This effectively divides by 2 in modular arithmetic, removing the overcount.

---

### **Example**
For `n = 7`, the DP gives `dp[7][14] = 8` (4 valid partitions × 2 overcounts). Applying the inverse of 2:
```
8 × 500,000,004 mod 1e9+7 = 4
```
This matches the sample answer.

---

### **Summary**
- **Overcounting**: The DP counts each partition twice (once for each subset).
- **Modular Division**: We use the modular inverse of 2 (`500,000,004`) to divide by 2 under modulo constraints.
- **Result**: The final answer is halved correctly, giving the number of unique partitions.

This ensures we count each partition exactly once, even when working modulo `1e9+7`.
